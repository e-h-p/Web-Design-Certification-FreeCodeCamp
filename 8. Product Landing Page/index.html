        <p class="content">
          In the first chapter of this assured debut novel, two young girls vanish, sending shock waves through a town perched on the edge of the remote, brooding Kamchatka Peninsula. What follows is a novel of overlapping short stories about the various women who have been affected by their disappearance. Each richly textured tale pushes the narrative forward another month and exposes the ways in which the women of Kamchatka have been shattered — personally, culturally and emotionally — by the crime.

          SHOOT THE MOON </h1>
        <p class="content">Historical fiction can be the ultimate delight for some and a bit intimidating for others. If you fall into the latter category but are open to diving into a new world, this month is providing you with a gem in Shoot the Moon. Readers meet Annie Fisk, whose heart (and mind) has belonged to the stars since she was just a child. When she finds herself landing a job at NASA during a very pivotal time as the agency is in the midst of its Apollo 11 mission, her dreams really do come true. But she’s constantly grappling with an insatiable curiosity that goes beyond her daily secretarial responsibilities. But Annie starts to question herself and her abilities when she realizes the team has missed something crucial in their calculations. Filled with all the thrills of space, a love interest, and more, this book will certainly grab your attention.</p>
